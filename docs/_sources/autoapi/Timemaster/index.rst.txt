.. py:class:: Timemaster

   .. method:: calc_truck_time(self, distance)


      This method takes a parameter (the distance that was traveled by the truck) and with the given
      miles per hour value accumulates how much time, down to the second, the truck needs to make the trip,
      converts it and returns a :mod:`datetime.timedelta` object.

      .. note::
          Time-complexity is O(1).

      :param float distance: The distance the truck drove on its route
      :returns: The time the truck took to finish its route
      :type: :mod:`datetime.timedelta`


   .. method:: time_converted_to_timedelta(self, time)


      This is a converter method that takes an argument, converts and returns the argument value as
      hours, minutes and seconds :func:`datetime.timedelta` object.

      .. note::
          Time-complexity is O(1).

      :param string time: in the format :mod:`00:00:00` to signify :mod:`hrs:mins:sec`
      :rtype: :mod:`datetime.timedelta`


   .. method:: military_to_normal_time(self, time_string)


      This method changes military time format to normal am/pm time format

      Example:

      >>> print (Timemaster.military_to_normal_time('13:00:00'))
      01:00:00 PM

      .. note::
          Time-complexity is O(1).

      :param string time_string: military time in the format :mod:`13:01:57`
      :rtype: string
